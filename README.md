# stm32f446_Experiment_Drivers
This repository I created in order to learn about how to create from scratch embedded drivers 

In the first commit I decide to experiment with the CRC driver from stm32f446re. 

Here is the UML diagram for how I plan to the driver works

And in here is the function separatly 

This function is for configure the data register

This function is for configure the independent data and control register

Please feel free to add me comments in order to improve my logic
